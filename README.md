## How to Play


**Gameplay:**
1. Press the "Start" button to initiate the game.

2. Simon will light up one color. Repeat the pattern by clicking on the same color.

3. After successfully repeating the first pattern, Simon will add a new color to the sequence.

4. Repeat the entire sequence, including the new color.

5. The game continues to add colors and increase the complexity as you progress through the rounds.

**Scoring:**
- Your score is based on the number of rounds you successfully complete.
- The higher the round, the more challenging the patterns become.

**Mistakes:**
- Making a mistake by clicking the wrong color ends the game.
- Pay attention to the pattern and try to memorize it.

**Sound and Visuals:**
- Each color has a distinct sound associated with it.
- The colors will light up in sequence along with the corresponding sounds.

**Winning:**
- The game continues until you make a mistake.
- Challenge yourself to achieve the highest possible score!


Enjoy playing the Simon Game!
